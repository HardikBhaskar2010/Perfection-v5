# Hardware Fundamentals

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Electronics

Welcome to the exciting world of electronics! This guide will take you from zero to hero in understanding electronic components and circuits.

### What is Electronics?

Electronics is the branch of physics and technology concerned with the design of circuits using transistors and microchips, and with the behavior and movement of electrons in various materials.

### Basic Concepts

**Voltage (V)**: The electrical potential difference between two points. Think of it as electrical pressure that pushes electrons through a circuit. Measured in Volts (V).

**Current (I)**: The flow of electric charge through a conductor. Like water flowing through a pipe, current measures how many electrons are moving past a point per second. Measured in Amperes (A).

**Resistance (R)**: Opposition to the flow of current. Different materials resist electron flow differently. Measured in Ohms (Ω).

**Ohm's Law**: The fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance:
V = I × R

This simple equation is the foundation of circuit analysis!
